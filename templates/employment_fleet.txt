[hr](The idea of the below section is that the Torch has received a document detailing this person's prior experience, and it's been attached to their records. If you're repurposing this for civilian use, make it into a resume, CV, HR record, or something along those lines.)
[h1]STATEMENT OF SERVICE[/h1]
[i]This is to certify the following information is true and correct:[/i]

[b]BRANCH:[/b] Fleet
[b]OPERATING FORCE:[/b] 3rd Fleet, 3rd Flag Group (Check the wiki and pick something that looks cool.)
[b]CURRENT COMMAND:[/b] 3rd Fleet Headquarters, SCGF Theia (Your character just got transferred here, so your 'current command' is probably going to be the name of the ship or military base they were on just before getting transferred.)
[b]SERVICE NUMBER:[/b] 113491392 (Make up a number.)

[b]STATUS:[/b] Active
[b]RATING:[/b] CMDMC (Google 'navy ratings' for inspiration. It's a two letter code for your character's job, if they're a Petty Officer it'll be XX3, XX2, XX1, if they're a M/S/CPO it'll be XXC, XXCS, XXCM. If your character's a CA or CN, just put CA or CN. If you want to find something to put in for an officer character, look up navy specializations instead of ratings.)
[b]PAY RATE:[/b] E-9 CMCPO (Rank and rank abbreviation.)
[b]ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE:[/b] 2540-07-19 (When did your character begin serving in active duty?)
[b]EXPIRATION OF SERVICE:[/b] None Listed (If your character isn't retiring, leave this alone.)
[b]COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR:[/b] Senior Enlisted Advisor, SEV Torch


[b]CURRENT QUALIFICATIONS:[/b][small][list][*]Discrimination Training (exp. 2562-07-01) (If your character's military, there's probably a lot of routine trainings they need to get, so make some up and fill some room around the important ones like weapons, EVA and so on)

[*]Physical Fitness (exp. 2563-03-01)
[*]Psychological Evaluation (exp. 2567-03-01)

[/list][/small]
[b]CURRENT CERTIFICATIONS:[/b][small][list][*]AECF Fire Control (These are some examples. I looked up what A-school a fire controlman would go to and put that here.)
[*]Fire Control Master Chief (FCCM) (For a PO2, 'Job Name Second Class', etc.)
[*]Fire Control - [i]Waterloo[/i] (Just some ships your character's certified to do their job on.)
[*]Fire Control - [i]Midway[/i]
[*]Fire Control - [i]Resolution[/i]
[*]Fire Control - [i]Mako[/i]

[*]SCPO Selection Board
[*]MCPO Selection Board
[*]Command Master Chief (CMDMC) Program
[*]Command Career Counselor Program (If you're repurposing these for civvies, look at trade certifications, or certifications by companies like Cisco or Oracle to work with their products.)
[/list][/small]
[b]CHRONOLOGICAL RECORD OF MILITARY SERVICE[/b] (Just make up some dates, leave a few days in between when your character might have been in transit before reporting to a new command. Basic is on Mars, AIT is Mars, that Fleet's headquarters, or somewhere else in SCG space. After that, they'll be on bases or ships belonging to the operating force listed earlier.)

[b]OVERALL NOTES:[/b] (Write some stuff here from a senior enlisted or your character's commanding officer, with the importance of that person proportional to your character's rank. If your character's a CA or CN, you're probably getting a note from a CPO, if they're a PO or CPO probably a CMCPO, if they're an officer probably an XO or CO is writing this, if they're a CMCPO, XO or CO then a flag officer might write this.)
[i]In my career I've had the pleasure of meeting all of the Third Fleet's Command Master Chief candidates, and all of them have impressed me -- even those whom I did not select to pass the CMDMC program. MCPO Reynolds is no exception. She is a brilliant mentor for our junior officers and I only reluctantly give her up to the Torch mission.[/i]

[i]The point of contact for this matter will be LCDR Robert Dahl at the 3rd Fleet headquarters in Theia.[/i]

[b]FROM:[/b] VADM Rebecca Mountbatten [i]via LCDR Robert Dahl[/i], 3rd Fleet, SFV Warspite (If the person writing this is important enough, they're going to have someone else send it for them ('via'). Think a CEO sending something via an executive assistant, for example.)
