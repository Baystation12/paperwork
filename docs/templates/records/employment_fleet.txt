[h1]STATEMENT OF SERVICE[/h1]
[i]This is to certify the following information is true and correct:[/i]

[b]BRANCH:[/b] Fleet
[b]OPERATING FORCE:[/b] (Nth Fleet), (Nth Group) (Find a unit here: https://wiki.baystation12.net/Defence_Forces/Fleet)
[b]CURRENT COMMAND:[/b] (Make up the name of the ship or military base your character was on just before getting transferred. This paperwork probably comes from them to the Torch, so )
[b]SERVICE NUMBER:[/b] 123456789 (Make up a number.)

[b]STATUS:[/b] Active
[b]RATING:[/b] (Google 'navy ratings'. For a theoretical master-at-arms, depending on rank, this would be CA, CN, MA3, MA2, MA1, MAC, MACS, or MACM. A Fleet brig officer is likely to have an MA1/MAC/MACS rating, a deck chief probably just a high deck technician rating. CMCPOs all have the rating CMDMC. This is US based and not official lore.)
[b]PAY RATE:[/b] E-4 MA3 (Rank and rank abbreviation.)
[b]ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE:[/b] YYYY-MM-DD (When did your character begin serving in active duty?)
[b]EXPIRATION OF SERVICE:[/b] YYYY-MM-DD (Probably 2-8 years in the future, or at the 20 years' service mark for an officer.)
[b]COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR:[/b] SEV Torch CMC (For officers, change it to XO.)


[b]CURRENT QUALIFICATIONS:[/b][small][list][*]Discrimination Training (exp. YYYY-MM-DD) (If your character's military, there's probably a lot of routine trainings they need to get, so make some up and fill some room around the important ones like weapons, EVA and so on)
[*]Extravehicular Activity (exp. YYYY-MM-DD)
[*]Physical Fitness (exp. YYYY-MM-DD)
[*]Psychological Evaluation (exp. YYYY-MM-DD)
[*]Sexual Assault Prevention (exp. YYYY-MM-DD)
[*]Small Arms Handling (exp. YYYY-MM-DD)

[b]CURRENT CERTIFICATIONS:[/b][small][list][*]AECF Fire Control (Just come up with a real or imagined advanced training school your character would go to and put that here, or don't if you have a simpler job.)
[*]Master-at-Arms 3rd Class
[*]More stuff related to your job
[*]More stuff related to your job

[*]General Radio Operator (One I sometimes put in for NCOs or command characters.)
[*](If you're repurposing these for civvies, look at trade certifications, or certifications by companies like Cisco or Oracle to work with their products.)
[/list][/small]
[b]CHRONOLOGICAL RECORD OF MILITARY SERVICE[/b] (Just make up some dates, leave a few days in between when your character might have been in transit before reporting to a new command. Basic is on Mars; AIT is Mars, wherever that Fleet's headquarters is, or somewhere else in SCG space. After that, they'll be on bases or ships belonging to the operating force listed earlier. Leave some breaks between ranks, a few weeks long most likely. Put some time into reading about the fleet your character is in, if they've been in a while, it's something you can bring up in conversation.)

[i]The point of contact for this matter will be Rank First Last at the CurrentCommand in WhateverSystem.[/i]
